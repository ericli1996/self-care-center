## User Instructions

  Sometimes we all we need is a bit of inspiration to keep going. On load, the page presents you with two options. You can select from either an affirmation or a mantra, and simply click on the "Receive Message" to show a message. In the lower box, the meditation symbol will disappear and you will be shown either a mantra or affirmation corresponding to your selection.

  If you don't like the message shown, click the "I don't like this message button", click the "OK" button on the "You won't see this message again" alert box, and it shows you a new message of your type selection, and will not show that message again.

- Modal Alert - Instead of seeing a default javascript alert, in which functionality of the page is paused until you click "OK", I would like a window to show above the main window, notifying that the message has been deleted, and to fade out by itself.

- Save a Custom Quote - User can input custom messages and save them to the list so they can be shown again.

- Login Page - User can access saved messages on their respective profile.

- Music Option - User checks "Tunes" radio button instead of "Affirmation" or "Mantra", and tunes play to sooth the soul.
